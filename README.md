This game is the final project for EW200 and is a simple top down frogger-like game. 

# Description
The objective of the game is to get to the other side of stribling wihout getting hit by the sprites/Gunnery Sergeants. The player character is controlled 
using the arrow keys and 'q' is used to quit out of the program. There are four python files associated along with a folder of sound files and a folder of image files.
The main python file is named Game.py.

# Acknowledgements
Xander Spees helped me throughout the making of the program. There are commented lines of code where I was stuck and needed to google a solution to an issue.
